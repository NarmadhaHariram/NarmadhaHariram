Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) operations are of extreme importance in the role of a Data engineer. A data engineer extracts data from multiple sources and different file formats, transforms the extracted data to predefined settings and then loads the data to a database for further processing.
 
In this lab, you will get hands-on practice of performing these operations you will be able to:

Read CSV, JSON, and XML file types.
Extract the required data from the different file types.
Transform data to the required format.
Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format, which can be loaded into an RDBMS.

Run the following commands in the terminal shell:

a. Download the zip file containing the required data in multiple formats.

wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0221EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%206/Lab%20-%20Extract%20Transform%20Load/data/source.zip
Copied!Executed!
b. Unzip the downloaded file.

1
unzip source.zip

Complete the following practice exercises:

Create a folder data_source and use the terminal shell to change the current directory to \home\project\data_source. Create a file etl_practice.py in this folder.

Download and unzip the data available in the link shared above.

The data available has four headers: 'car_model', 'year_of_manufacture', 'price', 'fuel'. Implement the extraction process for the CSV, JSON, and XML files.

Transform the values under the 'price' header such that they are rounded to 2 decimal places.

Implement the loading function for the transformed data to a target file, transformed_data.csv.

Implement the logging function for the entire process and save it in log_file.txt.

Test the implemented functions and log the events as done in the lab.
